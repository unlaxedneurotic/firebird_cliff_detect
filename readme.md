# Cliff and Object Detection - Fire Bird VI
This project uses the 8 inbuilt ultrasonic sensors and one additional ultrasonic sensor interfaced via Arduino Uno [Arduino Ultrasoninc Sensor HC-SR04] to detect objects and cliffs. The HC-SR04 sensor should be attached to the front of the robot via an extended rod and facing vertically down towards the floor. The setup looks something like the following diagrams.
